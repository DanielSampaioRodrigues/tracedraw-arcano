Gradient transparency uses the same geometry as gradient fills with
grayscale stops where white = opaque and black = transparent. The
object is rendered to a scratch layer, multiplied by the transparency
mask, then composited with the merge mode. A shaped gradient follows
the object's outline (`tests::shaped_transparency_follows_the_object`).

Uniform transparency with Normal is the object's opacity. With any
other merge mode it is kept as a mask of one grey (its lightness the
opacity, `mixed::uniform_mask`), drawn the same way, so Multiply and the
rest work on uniform transparency too, as in the reference program; the
Transparency part reads it back as Uniform with its amount and merge
mode (`mockup_tests::mockup_steps`).
