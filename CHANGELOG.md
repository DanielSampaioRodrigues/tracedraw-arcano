# Changes

Versions follow the tags of this repository; every push to `main` also
publishes a nightly build. [`docs/features.md`](docs/features.md) has the
full, row-by-row status.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-11)

The first release meant for everyone to try. It is an alpha: real
use will turn up bugs, and "Known limits" below lists what is known.

**Working in the window**
- Several drawings open in tabs; a Create a New Document dialog.
- The toolbox, palette, toolbars and status bar dock on any side or
  float, and the window remembers where they were.
- Keyboard shortcuts of your own for every menu command (Options >
  Customization > Commands), shown in the menus.
- A splash screen, an About box, an interface size option, tool cursors,
  a Hints panel with a page per tool, typed number fields and a status bar
  with object details and coordinates.
- Right-button drag of objects with a drop menu; menus switch as the
  pointer moves along the menu bar.

**Drawing and shaping**
- Shape tools draw a live preview while dragging; rectangle corners
  (round, scalloped, chamfered) per corner; complex stars.
- Common Shapes: 71 shapes in five sets (basic, arrows, flowchart,
  banners, callouts).
- Shape tool node transforms, reflection and segment copy; Corners, Join
  Curves and Coordinates panels.
- Snapping modes with marks and screen tips; a drawing scale and ruler
  calibration.
- Linked object styles and default properties for graphics, artistic text
  and paragraph text.

**Text**
- Drop caps sit on their lines and hyphenation breaks where it should;
  character offsets and angles; the Shape tool on text.

**Bitmaps**
- Colour modes, bitmap effects kept as an editable list apart from the
  pixels, image adjustments with tone curves, Straighten Image, Manually
  Inflate Bitmap and Convert to Bitmap options.
- Vector Mosaic and Picture Mosaic.

**Print and PDF**
- Preflight checks before printing; imposition and printers' marks.
- Publish to PDF with bookmarks, document properties, links and
  passwords (AES-256); protected PDFs open after asking for their
  password.
- Time Tracker: time spent on a drawing, task by task.

**Platforms**
- The whole editor runs in the browser (WebAssembly).
- Installers for Windows, macOS and Linux on every release, a Microsoft
  Store package in the build, and code signing ready to switch on.

**Known limits**
- Downloads are not code-signed yet: Windows SmartScreen asks for "More
  info > Run anyway", and macOS needs right-click > Open the first time.
- The `.cdr` reader is written from public notes and sample files; some
  files open with objects missing or looking different. Reports with a
  file are very welcome (there is an issue template for them).
- Gaps are listed in [`docs/blueprint-gaps.md`](docs/blueprint-gaps.md).

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-09)

First tagged version: the document model and command engine, the desktop
editor, the `.cdr` reader and writer, SVG, PDF and the other formats,
effects, text and the command-line tool.
