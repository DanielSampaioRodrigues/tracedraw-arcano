# Privacy policy

TraceDraw is a vector editor that runs on your own computer. This policy
covers the desktop program (installer, portable zip, Microsoft Store,
macOS and Linux packages), `tracedraw-cli` and the browser demo.

## What TraceDraw collects

Nothing. TraceDraw has no accounts, no telemetry, no analytics, no crash
reporting and no advertising. It does not send your drawings, your files
or anything about you or your computer anywhere, except what you ask AI
Drawing to send to the AI service you set up yourself (see below).

## What stays on your computer

- Your drawings, where you save them.
- Preferences, the Shelf and thumbnails of recent drawings, in
  TraceDraw's preferences folder (in the browser demo: the page's local
  storage in your browser). Deleting that folder removes them; Options >
  Global > Reset all settings puts the preferences back as they came.
- Automatic backups of open drawings, in the folder set in Options > Save
  (by default a `TraceDraw` folder in your system's temporary folder).
- AI Drawing's settings (service, address, model) with the preferences;
  your API key only if you tick "Remember the key on this computer", and
  then in plain text in the preferences file (in the browser demo: the
  page's local storage). Otherwise the key is forgotten when TraceDraw
  closes.

## When TraceDraw uses the network

Only when you ask it to:

- Help, the project's pages and links you click open in your web
  browser, which then follows its own privacy policy.
- Send To > Mail hands a file to your mail program; you choose whether to
  send it.
- `tracedraw --mcp` talks over standard input and output with the
  program that started it, on your computer; it opens no network port.
- AI Drawing (Tools > AI Drawing), only when you press Draw: it sends
  your request, the earlier requests of the same conversation and a
  description of the active page (its size, layers and objects: types,
  positions, colours and text; no file names or pictures) to the AI
  service whose address you entered, with your API key. That service
  handles them under its own terms and privacy policy. TraceDraw has no
  AI service of its own and sends nothing to its authors.

## The browser demo

The demo at <https://igtoth.github.io/tracedraw/> is a set of static
files served by GitHub Pages. TraceDraw itself sends nothing (AI Drawing
aside, as above, from your browser to the service you set up); GitHub, as
the host, may log visits as described in the
[GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).
Files you open in the demo stay in your browser.
